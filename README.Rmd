## Purpose

`lterSparcMaterialLegacy` provides shared utilities and workflows for analyzing
material legacy effects in LTER SPARC projects. It is designed to make
collaboration on datasets, analyses, and reporting consistent across the
community.

## Project status

- **Package name:** `lterSparcMaterialLegacy`.
- **Current purpose:** infrastructure plus early utilities that support data
  harmonization, documentation, and reproducible analysis.
- **Expected growth:** functions and datasets will expand as the project moves
  from exploratory work to cross-site synthesis and publication-ready outputs.

For the broader project overview and public-facing updates, visit the
[project website](https://lter.github.io/lter-sparc-material-legacy/).

## How to use this package (for now)

- Install from GitHub with `remotes::install_github("lter/lter-sparc-material-legacy")`.
- Load the package with `library(lterSparcMaterialLegacy)`.
- Expect a small, evolving set of helper functions focused on infrastructure;
  interfaces may change as the scientific workflow matures.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lter/lter-sparc-material-legacy")
```

## Quick example

```r
library(lterSparcMaterialLegacy)

hello_material_legacy("LTER")
```

## Notebooks and analyses

Exploratory notebooks and narrative analyses live in `project-notes/`. They
document decisions, prototypes, and analytical context, while stable functions
are promoted into the R package so they can be reused across sites and
workflows.
