# Project notes and exploratory analysis

This directory is for notebook-style, exploratory, or narrative analyses.
Notebooks capture decisions, prototypes, and analytical context, including dead
ends and rationale that inform the evolving workflow.

Not all code here is production-ready. When a workflow or function stabilizes,
it should be promoted into the R package (`R/`) with tests and documentation so
it can be reused across sites and analyses.
