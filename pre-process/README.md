# Material Legacy Pre-Processing

The harmonization workflow is _pretty_ flexible but not infinitely so. Operations that are completely idiosyncratic to a site are handled here before harmonization is attempted. Outputs are uploaded to the Shared Drive so that the scripts in this folder are not required to be run.

The primary idiosyncrasy is when one LTER site has multiple data files that must be joined to make the dataset of interest for this project.

## Script Explanations

- Scripts with a "_xxx" at the end of their name refer to the three-letter abbreviation of the relevant LTER site name. See [here](https://lternet.edu/site-characteristics/) for the full list of such abbreviations
