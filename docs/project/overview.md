# Material Legacy Effects

This repository captures legacy materials and exploratory work related to LTER-SPARC material legacy effects. The current focus is on organizing historical inputs and testing approaches for data harmonization across sites, rather than establishing new analytical outcomes.

## Entrypoint

The primary entrypoint is `00_setup.R`. Running this script initializes the expected data directories and supporting outputs:

- `data/raw`
- `data/raw/not-ready`
- `data/tidy`
- `graphs`

## Repo map

- `Sandbox/`: Ad-hoc experiments, scratch analyses, and exploratory notebooks/scripts. Expect mixed maturity and incomplete notes.
- `explore_centralized-harmonization/`: Work-in-progress exploration of centralized harmonization workflows and related artifacts.

## Getting started

1. Ensure R is available with the packages referenced in the scripts you plan to run.
2. Run `00_setup.R` from the repository root.
3. Review generated folder structure and any logs or output files created in the process.

## Status / Legacy note

This repository is a legacy workspace. Current status, ownership, and next steps are **TODO** and should be clarified in future updates.
