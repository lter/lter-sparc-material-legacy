# Repository structure

This repository is intentionally lightweight and preserves legacy materials in their existing locations.

## Top-level layout

- `00_setup.R`: Entry point that creates the expected data folders.
- `Sandbox/`: Scratch space for experiments and draft analyses.
- `explore_centralized-harmonization/`: Exploration of centralized harmonization approaches.
- `docs/`: Documentation site built with MkDocs.
- `graphs/`, `data/`: Generated outputs created when scripts run.

## Notes

The analysis workflows are exploratory and may not be complete. Update this page as new context or ownership information becomes available.
