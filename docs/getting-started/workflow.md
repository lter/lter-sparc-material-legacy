# Workflow

This repository follows a simple sequence:

1. **Raw data** → collected in `data/raw/` and staged in `data/raw/not-ready/` if incomplete.
2. **Tidy data** → cleaned outputs written to `data/tidy/`.
3. **Graphs** → figures and summary plots written to `graphs/`.

## Primary scripts

- `00_setup.R` initializes the folder structure and provides the starting point for data preparation.

## Script locations

- `Sandbox/` holds exploratory scripts and scratch analyses.
- `explore_centralized-harmonization/` captures work related to centralized harmonization experiments.

## TODO

Document specific scripts, their inputs/outputs, and how they relate to each other once verified.
