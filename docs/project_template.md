# Project notes (legacy template)

Use this page to capture general notes about legacy workflows, decisions, and next steps. This is intentionally lightweight and repo-agnostic.

## Checklist (update as needed)

- [ ] Confirm current project owner or point of contact. **TODO**
- [ ] Record data sources and update the [Data notes](data.md) page.
- [ ] Document any required R packages or system dependencies.
- [ ] Note known gaps, incomplete analyses, or missing outputs.

## Open questions

- What is the authoritative source for raw data files? **TODO**
- Which harmonization methods are considered canonical, if any? **TODO**
