# Data notes

This repository expects a simple raw → tidy workflow initialized by `00_setup.R`.

## Folder conventions

- `data/raw/`: incoming raw data files (format and source **TODO**).
- `data/raw/not-ready/`: raw files that need cleanup or metadata before use.
- `data/tidy/`: cleaned and standardized outputs intended for analysis.
- `graphs/`: figures and derived visual outputs.

## Data sources (TODO)

The original data sources, ingest procedures, and metadata conventions are not documented in this repository. Capture details here once identified.
