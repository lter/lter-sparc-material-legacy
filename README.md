## Script Explanations

- `00_setup.R` -- Create needed folders and download needed inputs for scripts from group's Google Drive
    - Note you need to be in this group to have access to that Drive!
- `01_harmonize.R` -- Standardize column names across input datasets and produce a single harmonized output
- `02_wrangle.R` -- Perform per-analysis wrangling (e.g., quality control, filtering, response summarization, etc.)
- `03_calc-effect-size.R` -- Fit relevant models, and extract effect sizes as well as model predictions 
- `99_upload.R` -- Upload products of any/all preceding scripts to group's Google Drive
    - Note you need to be in this group to have access to that Drive!

## Contributing Guidelines & Style Guide

When you have a group of people collaborating on a shared project (particularly a code-heavy one), it can be nice to create some guidelines to make sure everyone is contributing in consistent ways. Similarly if your group reaches consensus on a 'style' of file names and/or code it can be good to formalize those rules as well. The standard convention in GitHub is to create a file called "CONTRIBUTING.md" that contains all of this information. If you want some inspiration check out the LTER Scientific Computing team's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lter/scicomp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document!
